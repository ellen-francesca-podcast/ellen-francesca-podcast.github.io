Hi, we’re <a href="/people/#ellen">Ellen</a> and <a href="/people/#francesca">Francesca</a>, two third-year Phd students working on computational biology with a background in Artificial Intelligence. 

Already before we started our PhD we liked to discuss science and our experiences in the academic world together. By sharing our discussion online we hope to create a communal space for sharing your PhD experience and relating to each other.
