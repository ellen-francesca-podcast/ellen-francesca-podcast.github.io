This template is split into three parts: **Review**, **Reflect**, and **Plan**. It's based on how I plan my own year, as well as some books, podcasts & videos I've found helpful over the years. 

Even if you don't use this exact template, I recommend structuring your annual review into these three sections: 

1.  Review the last year 
2.  Reflect on the remainder of your PhD
3.  Plan for the new year

Skipping one often leaves me with less clarity about my goals or worse leads me to not acting on them (since I didn't define actionable next steps). That said, feel free to take whatever feels useful to you and leave what doesn't. This template is simply meant to help you approach your PhD more proactively :) 

I'd love to hear any thoughts, feedback or recommendations you have! 

<div class="section-header">
  <h2>PART 1 - 2025 Review</h2>
</div>

It's easy to forget what happened over the past year, especially in the earlier months. To avoid *recency bias*, I like to reconstruct my year month by month. This helps me provide a clear picture of where I spend my time, achievements and challenges I had completely forgotten about, and what events shaped my year.

### Create a timeline of the past year 📅

Go through your calendar, GitHub, experiment logs, lab notebooks, Teams/Slack, and email.

Fill in *verifiable* milestones (papers, experiments, conferences, teaching, pivots, etc.)

| Month     | Key Achievements / Outputs | Conferences / Talks / Teaching | Skills / Learning | Notes |
| --------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------- | ----- |

  <h2>PART 2 - Reflect on the remainder of your PhD</h2>
</div>

### Time awareness ⏳
At the start of your PhD, four years can feel like an almost infinite stretch of time (which in theory it is) but in reality, it passes far more quickly than we expect. Inspired by *Four Thousand Weeks* by Oliver Burkeman and a [great blog post](https://ahappyphd.org/posts/productivity-mortal-phds/) by Luis P. Prieto, I added a section on time awareness to my annual review. Understanding how much time I actually have left to spend on pure research helps me prioritise what to focus on. I hope it helps you too!

Below you can see an overview of categories I considered. You can be as detailed or broad as you want to. I based my estimations on 2025 and meetings I already knew would happen this year.

| Category                                                                                 | Estimated days per year | Years affected | Total days                |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------- |
| _Meetings (thesis advisory, 1-on-1s, lab meetings, journal clubs, collaborations, etc.)_ |                         |                | `Estimated × Years = [ ]` |
| _Travel (conferences, summer schools, talks, retreats, etc.)_                            |                         |                | `Estimated × Years = [ ]` |
| _Teaching (preparation, supervisions, exams, grading, etc.)_                             |                         |                | `Estimated × Years = [ ]` |
| _Training (workshops, courses, etc.)_                                                    |                         |                | `Estimated × Years = [ ]` |
| _Annual leave and sick days_                                                             |                         |                | `Estimated × Years = [ ]` |
| _Other projects (revisions, reviews, hackathons, etc.)_                                  |                         |                | `Estimated × Years = [ ]` |
| _Thesis writing_                                                                         |                         |                | `Estimated × Years = [ ]` |
| _Admin tasks_                                                                            |                         |                | `Estimated × Years = [ ]` |
| **TOTAL**                                                                                |                         |                | `Sum of all Total days`   |

<div class="time-calc">
  <p>📊 <strong>Total remaining days in PhD:</strong> _______</p>
  <p>⏱️ <strong>Estimated days spent on non-research tasks:</strong> _______</p>
  <p>🔬 <strong>Estimated days available for research:</strong> _______</p>
</div>

**Reflection Prompts (Optional)**
- *What are your current top priorities?*
- *What are your biggest time sinks right now?*
- *Are there any tasks/goals that you no longer want to spend time on (a not-to-do list)?*


### How would an ideal PhD look like for you? ✨

Define your ideal vs good-enough PhD. Try to be as specific as possible. 

**Reflection Prompts (Optional)**
- *What would an **ideal average week** in your PhD look like?*
- *What are your ideal contributions (research outputs, projects, experiments, papers, software)?*
- *What skills do you want to graduate with?*
- *Which conferences would you like to attend? What talks or presentations would you like to give?*
- *What does a **good-enough PhD** look like for you?*
- *What is your minimum viable thesis?*

Consider research output, skills, work-life balance, and your ambitions/goals. Defining your own "good enough" helps you set realistic expectations and prevents perfectionism from derailing progress.


### Build a quarterly roadmap

*What steps would you need to follow each quarter to achieve your good-enough PhD?*

| Quarter | Main objectives | Deadlines |
| ------- | --------------- | --------- |
| Q1      |                 |           |
| Q2      |                 |           |
| Q3      |                 |           |
| Q4      |                 |           |


### Failure planning and risk mitigation 🛡️

<div class="highlight-box">
Thinking proactively about risks can help you <strong>stay on track, prevent burnout, and protect your priorities</strong> (Klein 2007, Kahneman 2011).
</div>

**1. Identify potential risks:**

*What could prevent you from achieving your good-enough PhD?*

<p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #666;">Mention at least 3 major risks.</p>

**2. Plan safeguards and mitigation strategies:**

*What could you do to safeguard against each major risk?*  

<p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #666;">For each risk, define specific actions you can take to reduce its likelihood or impact.</p>

**Other reflection prompts:**
- *Who could notice early if you're drifting?*
- *What priorities will you protect when things get busy?* 


### Summarise your main goals for this year ✅



Plan the your goals for the next year and assign each goal a priority (low, medium, high). This will make it easier to prioritise your goals later on.

</div>


### Annual Overview
Use this section to map out your year at a high level. This is <strong>a work in-progress</strong>, so review and update it frequently!

Fill in major deadlines, events, and goals. Add concrete **actions** for each goal to make it achievable.

**Prompts:**
- *What are my biggest priorities this year (research, papers, experiments, skills, teaching, networking)?*
- *When are deadlines for conferences, coursework, funding applications, or important submissions?*
- *What actions will help me achieve each goal (e.g. order books, schedule focused writing sessions, attend a workshop)?*
- *Which months are likely to be high-pressure and require buffer time?*

| Month     | Deadlines / Milestones | Events | Goals / Projects | Risks | Actions |
| --------- | ---------------------- | ------ | ---------------- | ----- | ------- |

<div class="highlight-box">
  <ul>
    <li>Focus on <strong>1–3 key priorities per month</strong> to maintain focus and avoid feeling overwhelmed.</li>
    <li>Use the <strong>Risks</strong> column to note anything that might prevent you from achieving each goal (e.g., not making time for reading due to other deadlines).</li>
    <li>Use the <strong>Actions</strong> column to list concrete steps that reduce these risks and move the goal forward (e.g., schedule a dedicated recurring event in your calendar).</li>
  </ul>
</div>

### Learning & skills 🧠
You might, like me, find it difficult to schedule learning goals on a monthly basis. I recommend planning them quarterly instead, and identifying interesting resources, potential risks, and concrete actions for each skill and topic in advance. Often you need to sign up for training courses months in advance. Learning and skill development can easily feel less urgent than immediate research tasks, which makes it easy to neglect them. However, consistently making time to acquire new skills and read will ultimately make you a better researcher and I would argue should be an essential part of your PhD.


**Prompts:**
- *Which skills are essential to complete your research or advance your career this year?*
- *What topics would you like to explore just out of pure curiosity?*
- *What resources (books, courses, mentors, workshops) will help you develop these skills?*
- *What specific actions will ensure progress (e.g., schedule reading sessions, sign up for a summer school )?*

| Quarter | Skills / Topics to Learn | Resources / References | Risks | Actions |

| Q1      |                          |                        |       |         |

| Q3      |                          |                        |       |         |
