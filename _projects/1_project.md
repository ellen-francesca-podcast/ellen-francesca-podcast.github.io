**Description:** Time management in a PhD isn’t about cramming more work into your day. It’s about working intentionally in a system that was never designed for clear boundaries. In this episode, we explore why managing time in academia feels uniquely challenging, from open-ended goals and constant guilt to the pressure of an always-on culture. Inspired by Four Thousand Weeks and Luis P. Prieto’s insightful homage,
Two Hundred Weeks: Productivity for Mortal PhD Students, we discuss strategies for *mortal* PhD students: practical planning systems, boundary-setting approaches, and sustainable productivity tools that protect both progress and wellbeing. With roughly 200 weeks to complete a PhD, how you spend your time truly matters.
